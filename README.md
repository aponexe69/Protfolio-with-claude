Create a modern, visually stunning advanced portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website should include:

A sleek landing page with smooth entry animations

Advanced grid effects for showcasing projects or content

A custom animated cursor effect for enhanced interactivity

Floating UI elements to create a sense of depth and motion

3D live mockups to showcase projects dynamically

Smooth scroll-triggered animations and transitions

A live animated background (e.g., particles, gradients, or canvas-based effects)

The design should be responsive, aesthetically clean, and interactive, suitable for a high-end creative portfolio.
